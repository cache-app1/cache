# Cache

**Stop scrolling. Start searching.**

You've got hundreds of screenshots - recipes, travel plans, receipts, outfits - and no real way to find any of them. Cache reads every screenshot with AI, works out what it is, and lets you search your whole camera roll in plain English. You don't have to remember *when* you saved something, just *what* it was.

## What it does

- **Search the way you talk.** "That pasta recipe I saved" or "my Seattle itinerary" - Cache goes off what you mean, not just matching keywords.
- **Organizes itself.** Every screenshot gets read, categorized, and tagged the moment you upload it. No folders, no sorting.
- **Stays private.** Your screenshots are locked to your account with row-level security - no one else can see what you upload, signed in or as a guest.

## How it works

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/assets/how-it-works-diagram.png" alt="Upload, AI reads it, it's organized automatically, then you search in plain English" width="640">
</p>

Upload a screenshot, an AI model pulls out the text and figures out what it is, it gets tagged and indexed, and later you find it by describing it in your own words.

Next.js and Tailwind on Vercel, with Supabase handling auth, file storage, and a Postgres + pgvector database. A vision model reads each screenshot; embeddings power the semantic search. Full writeup in [docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md).
