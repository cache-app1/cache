# Cache

**Stop scrolling. Start searching.**

Cache is an AI-powered screenshot manager that transforms your camera roll into a searchable library. Instead of scrolling through hundreds of saved screenshots, Cache automatically extracts text, understands context, categorizes your content, and helps you find exactly what you're looking for using natural language.

Whether it's a recipe you saved weeks ago, a travel itinerary, a receipt, a note, or an outfit inspiration post, Cache makes your screenshots easy to organize and even easier to find.

**Live Demo:** https://cache-cacheshots.vercel.app

## Features

- **Natural Language Search**
  - Search using everyday language, such as:
    - "Show me the pasta recipe I saved."
    - "Find my Seattle itinerary."
    - "Receipt from Costco."

- **AI-Powered Organization**
  - Automatically extracts text from screenshots and categorizes them based on their content.

- **Smart Categories**
  - Organizes screenshots into categories such as recipes, travel, shopping, receipts, notes, quotes, events, social media, and more.

- **Responsive Interface**
  - A clean, modern interface designed for fast browsing and effortless searching across devices.

- **Secure Authentication**
  - User accounts ensure screenshots remain private and accessible only to their owner.

- **Private by Design**
  - Every screenshot is scoped to your account with row-level security in the database — no one else can ever see what you upload, whether you sign in with an account or use a guest session.

## Vision

People save screenshots because they don't want to lose information, but finding that information later is often frustrating. Cache transforms your screenshot collection into a searchable knowledge base by combining AI-powered understanding with an intuitive interface.

Instead of remembering when you saved something, you only need to remember what it was.
